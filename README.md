<h4>JQuery</h4>
<p>This is used for DOM manipulation. Clicking the button that displays the location of the image removes the current images, loads the images from /images, picks the images with the same tag as the button, appends the links of the images at the gallery.html under .bxslider, and reload the slider. Default is set as the first button(Indonesia) that calls the images with tag "Indonesia".</p>
